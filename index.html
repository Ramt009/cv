        <p><em>Repetition achieves <strong><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mastery#:~:text=1a%20%3A%20the%20authority%20of,master%20of%20a%20subject%20%3A%20command">mastery</a></strong> triumphantly</em></p>
        <p>I started climbing in January 2017 when I joined a meetup at a bouldering gym.
          I quickly progressed from V2s to V7s within one year. In June, 2018 I
          climbed outdoors for the first time at Tramway (San Jacinto Mountains) and sent my first V4 boulder called <em>Square Dance</em>.
          In 2019, I attempted to climb a lot of boulders,
          anywhere from V0s all the way to a V8. The only notable climb I was able to send
          that season was a roof climb V4 called <em>Standing On The Head Of The Dragon.</em>
          During the pandemic and quarantine period that dominated most of 2020, I
          did not climb outdoors. I was only able to climb indoors for short periods of time, however
          I felt stronger than ever and sent multiple V8s. On August 14, 2021, I went
          outdoors again and to my surprise, sent <em>Swing Dance</em>, a popular benchmark
          V7 boulder. Feeling very ecstatic that my training has finally paid, I decided to document my climbing journey to record my
          progression, training, technique and strength.
